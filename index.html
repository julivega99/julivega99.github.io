          <div class="infoTitle">Twitter <br> Full Stack Developer <br>(July 2021 ‚Äì November 2022)</div>
          <div class="infoDescription">I worked at Twitter for 16 months. As a recent grad, I was welcome to the Consumer Privacy team as a full-stack software engineer 
            with a font-end focus. There, I learned to work on projects with cross-functional partners, improved my coding skills, and welcomed the Twitter culture.  
            <br>

            During my time at Twitter, I went from not knowing anything to owning full projects and being the only one to have the knowledge for certain areas. 
            I was part of this company during a tumultuous time: CEO stepping down, acquisition, re-orgs, layoffs. Thus, I learned to focus and work hard during 
            uncertain and stressful times. 
            <br>
            
            I worked and lead projects that impacted millions of users, for example: the 2022 privacy policy update, the EU cookie notification for Twitter to be FTC compliant, 
            the Data Archive Renderer (the HTML page that renders when you <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data/request_data">download your Twitter data</a>), 
            and a few settings tweaks. Additionally, I also worked on internal tools for the Legal Compliance Core team that helped legal request user data more easily. <br>

          <div class="infoDescription">Snap was my first industry experience. There, I learned to value privacy, to work in big tech, and what software engineer entails. 
            I worked on the Privacy Engineering team as an intern for two summers. Best school I could have ever asked for. </div>

          <div class="infoTitle"> Computer Science Teaching Fellow<br> 2019 - 2021</div>
          <div class="infoDescription">One of the reasons I studied computer science was because of the Teaching Assitants. They are the ones that helped me when I felt like 
            giving up because of a bug. Thus, I wanted to return the favor. I became a teaching assistant in 2019 for Introduction to Computer Science and then switched to 
            Data Structures. As a teaching assistant, you hold office hours and teach labs. After a couple semesters as a TA, I became a Teaching Fellow, which is the one of
            4-ish students who manage the TA‚Äôs and work closely with the professor. One of the best communities I have been a part of.  </div>
